After all, strains of mechanized dystopianism were emerging as early as the beginning of our current decade (perhaps as a response to the global failings of&lt;a href="https://roarmag.org/magazine/ian-bruff-authoritarian-neoliberalism/" target="_blank"&gt; authoritarian neoliberalism&lt;/a&gt;, of which Trump himself is but an outgrowth). The early ‘10s were when we saw the first brooding recordings from Noah Anthony’s Profligate project, as well as key technoid murk from Silent Servant and Dominick Fernow’s more rhythmic cuts under his Vatican Shadow alias. Yet there can be little doubt that what started off as isolated pockets of activity has spread across experimental noise, avant-rock and -metal, and techno and coalesced into a full-blown movement. In terms of productivity and sheer inventiveness, this boom can rightly be compared to its predecessor scene of the late ’80s, back when industrial seeped into club music, ambient, folk, rock, and beyond.Indeed, many of 2018’s most vital underground records come caked in industrial grime. First and foremost, there’s Hiro Kone’s &lt;em&gt;Pure Expenditure&lt;/em&gt;. Released on&lt;a href="https://daisrecords.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"&gt; Dais Records&lt;/a&gt;, arguably the label most responsible for documenting the modern scene, Kone collapses dark techno and DIY electronics in on themselves, resulting in shattered groove research that’s both intensely complex and unapologetically visceral. Back in March, Dais also dropped &lt;em&gt;Castration Anxiety&lt;/em&gt;, the debut full-length from HIDE. Featuring howler Heather Gabel, known for her unpromising&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/oCzQyunba_g" target="_blank"&gt; stage performances&lt;/a&gt;, and Seth Sher, formerly of noise-rockers Coughs, the Chicago duo specialize in a slowly hammering take on rock-oriented industrial that,&lt;a href="https://artists.spotify.com/blog/hides-heather-gabel-on-motherhood-late-starts-and-industrial-rage" target="_blank"&gt; according to Gabel&lt;/a&gt;, transforms the illnesses plaguing modern society into violent catharsis.Falling somewhere between Kone and HIDE in its balance of brute force with psychic despair is Lana Del Rabies’ &lt;em&gt;Shadow World&lt;/em&gt;, released on&lt;a href="https://deathbombarc.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"&gt; Deathbomb Arc&lt;/a&gt;, a California label that manages to document trajectories in both weirdo noise and outsider hip-hop. It’s an apt album title as the musician’s work seems to be forged inside a shadowy, liminal space that while informed by industrial also draws in elements of electronic music and an echo-drenched angst commonly associated with older styles of alt-rock. In fact, a lot of the artists found on our playlist share this very quality to varying degrees. If their ’80s counterparts pledged allegiance to industrial as though it were a political movement, their 21st-century descendants tend to avoid labelling themselves so vociferously—an anarchist’s devotion to Individual autonomy rather party solidarity, so to speak.Another big difference between the current industrial/industrial-leaning scene and its forebears in the ’80s is the sheer number of female artists now exploring these sounds. Back then, shit could get absurdly macho. (Strands of industrial rock even devolved into straight&lt;a href="http://coilhouse.net/2012/11/on-misogyny-in-industrial-music/" target="_blank"&gt; misogyny&lt;/a&gt;.) This time around, however, the most thrilling music is being made by women. In addition to Kone, Gabel, and Lana Del Rabies, there’s Puce Mary, Boy Harsher’s Jae Matthews, and Anna Schmidt of Milliken Chamber.Add to them to key cuts and remixes from JK Flesh, The Soft Moon, Imperial Black Unit, Uniform and The Body, and you’re definitely in for one hellishly immersive listening experience-- yet liberatory, too. Yes, a lot of this music &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; despairing, but through its thick, gauzy bleakness you’ll hear fresh, new voices burning with defiance and nonconformity, and that can only be an uplifting thing in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="380" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/202KyMGSFfRoPtPtLlFkA4?utm_source=generator" style="border-radius:12px" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

Sweater-weather vibes and hummable melodies were in large supply in 2017 both in the U.S. and abroad. Cheeky British act Peaness (pictured) collected its recent output, including the stellar love song "Seafoam Islands," on &lt;em&gt;Are You Sure?&lt;/em&gt;; Chicago scrappers Varsity released the spaced-out yet self-protective "Settle Down"; and British trio Girl Ray put out the stunning, exploratory &lt;em&gt;Earl Grey&lt;/em&gt;, which triangulated the songcraft of Carole King, the wooliness of mid-90s K Records, and the exacting wit of Squeeze (as well as a prog freak-out or two) into a gorgeous record.A few of the labels from my 90s college-radio heyday—when I first grew heart-eyed over indie-pop—are still at it, putting out lovingly&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;detailed pop albums. The Spain-based label Elefant, which has been operating since 1989, released La Bien Queridas breezy &lt;em&gt;Fuego&lt;/em&gt;, which surrounds the chilled-out alto of Ana Fernández-Villaverde in urgent synths ("Si Me Quieres a Mi") and squiggly guitars ("El Lado Bueno"). The 10-inch by the resurgent British act The Primitives, also an Elefant release, soared with "Ill Trust The Wind," which combined a singsong earworm with guitar fuzz. Matinée Recordings launched in 1997 and this year released a slew of records that included the chiming &lt;em&gt;Other Towns Than Ours&lt;/em&gt; by Melbournes Last Leaves, which includes three-quarters of the brainy Aussie indiepoppers The Lucksmiths. The 20th-anniversary comp &lt;a href="http://matineerecordings.com/item.php?item_id=269"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matinée Idols&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; throws back to the days of various-artists-CD-based discovery with a Last Leaves track as well as the Snapchat-era lament "Me, My Selfie and I" by Scots Strawberry Whiplash and "Postcard" from the sweetly synthy Swedish band The Electric Pop Group. (&lt;a href="http://jenslekman.com/postcards.htm"&gt;Postcards also figured into the making&lt;/a&gt; of Jens Lekmans gorgeously forthright &lt;em&gt;Life Will See You Now&lt;/em&gt;.)The labels that are still kicking almost make up for the sting of losing Fortuna POP!, the UK-based label that announced its shutdown after 22 years in business and punctuated said farewell with the dreamy Flowers track "Say 123," which combines chugging guitars and vocalist Rachel Kennedys spectral soprano. Bittersweet feelings are crucial to indie-pop, though, so the beauty of that song at least made for a fitting goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="380" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/5hrDkhoBqgbouUrbcfEHvM?utm_source=generator" style="border-radius:12px" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

But the legacy left behind by the man who made rock ‘n’ roll what it is today largely rests on a relatively small group of milestone singles—about a dozen or so, mostly released between the mid ’50s and mid ’60s. And, when you’re talking about an artist like Berry, that leaves a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of things out. On this collection of Chuck Berry esoterica, you’ll find just about everything you can think of and then some: calypso, jazz, Latin-tinged jams, psychedelic experimentation—you name it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/third_bridge_creative/playlist/3GI1Ks3BqZZn7zRL3W7EzQ"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/man-built-808/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Man Who Built the 808&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to imagine what hip-hop, house, and techno might have used for a rhythmic foundation if not for the 808 beat. That’s why the impact that inventor Ikutaro Kakehashi—who passed away April 1 at age 87—had on the past four decades of music is incalculable. Since the fine 2015 documentary &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMPzuRWoNgE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;808&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tells you everything you could want to know on the subject (and way more), we let the music do the talking with a set that includes many of the most famous uses of the 808 (and its successor the TR-909) by early adopters like Arthur Baker as well as such present-day devotees as Kanye West, who transformed the beat into the sonic epitome of emotional desolation on &lt;em&gt;808s And Heartbreak.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/third_bridge_creative/playlist/3Zxfh6jFK5HodqfJ7es84j"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/hip-priest-musical-legacy-jonathan-demme/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hip Priest: The Musical Legacy of Jonathan Demme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few filmmakers ever displayed as much savvy about music—or were so eager to show off their sheer love of it—than Jonathan Demme. The director, who passed away on April 26 at the age of 73 after a battle with cancer, established his impeccable and impressively diverse tastes—from The Fall and The Feelies to Big Youth and Boogie Down Productions—long before indie-movie hotshots like Quentin Tarantino and Wes Anderson followed suit in the 1990s. This playlist includes the iconic tracks famously featured in his films, as well as selections from the many musicians with whom Demme collaborated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/third_bridge_creative/playlist/6anzHEWx6geyjT8NKPhT8W"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/chris-cornell-outside-garden/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Cornell: Outside the Garden&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The late Chris Cornell—who took his own life on May 18 at age 52—was one of the most dynamic and adventurous singers to emerge in the ’90s. This playlist highlights the underrated non-Soundgarden songbook of the only rock vocalist to have worked with both Timbaland and the Zac Brown Band, while always sounding unmistakably like himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/third_bridge_creative/playlist/3sKQZ2P2m8mYo87MTMTtg8"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/prodigys-best-verses/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prodigy’s Best Verses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prodigy of Mobb Deep was one of the best rappers on the planet because he was dark. He didn’t have Pac’s tortured-thug activist energy, Big’s charisma or hitmaking ease, or Nas’s wisdom combined with the ear of a jazz musician. It didn’t matter. While other rappers laughed and joked, or screamed in your ear, Prodigy calmly explained how he would end your life while referencing the Book of Revelations and the Illuminati. The MC passed away on June 20 at age 42 from complications related to a painful life-long fight with sickle-cell anemia; this playlist salutes the greatest writer of threats in rap history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/third_bridge_creative/playlist/3MZhkDb6UrrouBIMP9e6Mi"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/linkin-park-much-nu-metal-band/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Linkin Park Were So Much More Than a Nu-Metal Band&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s something almost transcendental about early Linkin Park. They were too anthemic to be fully nu metal, too hip-hop to be rock, and too emo and mainstream to be “cool.” But Chester Bennington’s lyrics had a radically human core, one that embraced and tried to work through longing and alienation. And their music was very intriguing, boasting intelligent percussion, authoritative washes of reverbed guitar, disciplined use of electronics, and methodical pacing. In the wake of Bennington’s shocking suicide July 20 at age 41, we published this playlist tribute to a band who, for certain angst-ridden teenagers, were like The Smiths of their era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/third_bridge_creative/playlist/6TerCjKDEcGQTSVUlhv6Xp"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/best-steely-dan-samples/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Best Steely Dan Samples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Fagen and Walter Becker were already anachronisms when they met as jazz-obsessed teenagers in the late ‘60s and began to write the droll, harmonically complex songs that made Steely Dan one of the greatest and most unique bands of the ‘70s. So it’s not surprising that a duo who worked tirelessly to get the best performances out of skilled session players never had much interest in hip-hop and the art of sampling. But the Steely Dan songs that have been sampled by multiple rap artists offer a case study in how many options the band’s rich arrangements offer to beatmakers. Becker, sadly, passed away from esophageal cancer on September 3 at age 67. But his music lives on—and continues to find new audiences—through the many hip-hop, rock, and R&amp;amp;B tracks collected here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/third_bridge_creative/playlist/60Ul7Jb05fmzOF3H7JTr6z"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/grant-harts-greatest-songs/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grant Hart’s Greatest Songs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;With ’80s noise-pop pioneers Husker Dü, Grant Hart played the misfit McCartney to Bob Mould’s lacerating Lennon, providing the honey chaser to his partner’s hoarse-throat howls. Following the band’s extremely acrimonious break-up, Hart gradually faded into obscurity, releasing a small handful of under-the-radar records while Mould enjoyed a steady, successful career as an alt-rock elder statesman. Recent years had been especially trying: Hart lost both parents in quick succession, and he was injured in a fire that destroyed his longtime family home in South St. Paul. And then 2017 brought the diagnosis of the kidney cancer that ultimately claimed him on September 14 at the age of 56. With this playlist, we pay tribute to the man who forged the Dave Grohl prototype of the shit-hot drummer who also a tender tunesmith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/third_bridge_creative/playlist/511Ud3dSzaIbrC7YuhtRUv"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/tom-petty-remembered/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Petty Remembered&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before his death from cardiac arrest on October 2 at age 66, Tom Petty was a man of the people in a way that Dylan and Springsteen couldn’t be, because they just seemed too oversized, too mythic, too huge from the get-go. Like the characters he tended to write about, Petty was always somewhere between underdog and self-made outcast. Yet the chip on his shoulder was the rare and beautiful kind that seemed to make him more empathetic to people rather than less so. That’s what you hear in these songs, some of which are hits, while others are deep cuts from albums that didn’t quite get as much love as they should’ve. (For more, &lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/petty-persuasion/"&gt;check out this playlist&lt;/a&gt; of the contemporary artists keeping Petty’s spirit alive.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/third_bridge_creative/playlist/0Ifoc2q3AIBsoVS5wA3GB1"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/non-canadians-guide-understanding-gord-downie/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Non-Canadian’s Guide to Understanding Gord Downie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gord Downie was effectively Canada’s Bruce Springsteen—a rock star with blue-collar blood, whose intimate portraits of Canadian life could stir a patriotic fervor with a simple small-town namedrop. His band, The Tragically Hip, was huge in Canada and in Canada only, however, since Downie’s untimely passing from brain cancer on October 18 at age 53, more people outside the country are tuning into his peculiar genius. Here’s a playlist of 23 songs to introduce non-Canadian newcomers to Downie’s deep discography. While it includes some Hip hits, these aren’t necessarily the band’s most popular songs. Rather, they’re ones that mostly venture beyond the band’s bar-rock roots and don’t require an Encyclopedia Canadiana to decode. And they’re the ones that most directly communicate Downie’s singular combination of outsized passion, white-knuckled intensity, sly humor, absurdity… and grace, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/third_bridge_creative/playlist/3d6nCT4MXMXvbo9Vbh2hV9"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/ac-dcs-greatest-riffs-non-hits-edition/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AC/DC’s Greatest Riffs (Non-Hits Edition)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If his brother, Angus, is AC/DC’s Chuck Berry (all about dazzling flashes of lightning and speeding, razor-wire licks) then Malcolm Young was their Bo Diddley, a brilliant groove engineer (as well as songwriter—let’s not forget that) who could ceaselessly combine and recombine the essential, fundamental components of boogie. We present a cannonballed salute to the greatest rhythm guitarist in hard rock, who passed away November 18 at age 64 after a years-long struggle with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/third_bridge_creative/playlist/7mj4II7rGtRhjvFWATDrfJ"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;None&lt;/div&gt;</content>

On this collection of Chuck Berry esoterica, you’ll find just about everything you can think of and then some: calypso, jazz, Latin-tinged jams, psychedelic experimentation—you name it.The Man Who Built the 808It’s impossible to imagine what hip-hop, house, and techno might have used for a rhythmic foundation if not for the 808 beat. That’s why the impact that inventor Ikutaro Kakehashi—who passed away April 1 at age 87—had on the past four decades of music is incalculable. Since the fine 2015 documentary 808 tells you everything you could want to know on the subject (and way more), we let the music do the talking with a set that includes many of the most famous uses of the 808 (and its successor the TR-909) by early adopters like Arthur Baker as well as such present-day devotees as Kanye West, who transformed the beat into the sonic epitome of emotional desolation on 808s And Heartbreak.Hip Priest: The Musical Legacy of Jonathan DemmeFew filmmakers ever displayed as much savvy about music—or were so eager to show off their sheer love of it—than Jonathan Demme. The director, who passed away on April 26 at the age of 73 after a battle with cancer, established his impeccable and impressively diverse tastes—from The Fall and The Feelies to Big Youth and Boogie Down Productions—long before indie-movie hotshots like Quentin Tarantino and Wes Anderson followed suit in the 1990s. This playlist includes the iconic tracks famously featured in his films, as well as selections from the many musicians with whom Demme collaborated.Chris Cornell: Outside the GardenThe late Chris Cornell—who took his own life on May 18 at age 52—was one of the most dynamic and adventurous singers to emerge in the ’90s. This playlist highlights the underrated non-Soundgarden songbook of the only rock vocalist to have worked with both Timbaland and the Zac Brown Band, while always sounding unmistakably like himself.Prodigy’s Best VersesProdigy of Mobb Deep was one of the best rappers on the planet because he was dark. He didn’t have Pac’s tortured-thug activist energy, Big’s charisma or hitmaking ease, or Nas’s wisdom combined with the ear of a jazz musician. It didn’t matter. While other rappers laughed and joked, or screamed in your ear, Prodigy calmly explained how he would end your life while referencing the Book of Revelations and the Illuminati. The MC passed away on June 20 at age 42 from complications related to a painful life-long fight with sickle-cell anemia; this playlist salutes the greatest writer of threats in rap history.Why Linkin Park Were So Much More Than a Nu-Metal BandThere’s something almost transcendental about early Linkin Park. They were too anthemic to be fully nu metal, too hip-hop to be rock, and too emo and mainstream to be “cool.” But Chester Bennington’s lyrics had a radically human core, one that embraced and tried to work through longing and alienation. And their music was very intriguing, boasting intelligent percussion, authoritative washes of reverbed guitar, disciplined use of electronics, and methodical pacing. In the wake of Bennington’s shocking suicide July 20 at age 41, we published this playlist tribute to a band who, for certain angst-ridden teenagers, were like The Smiths of their era.The Best Steely Dan SamplesDonald Fagen and Walter Becker were already anachronisms when they met as jazz-obsessed teenagers in the late ‘60s and began to write the droll, harmonically complex songs that made Steely Dan one of the greatest and most unique bands of the ‘70s. So it’s not surprising that a duo who worked tirelessly to get the best performances out of skilled session players never had much interest in hip-hop and the art of sampling. But the Steely Dan songs that have been sampled by multiple rap artists offer a case study in how many options the band’s rich arrangements offer to beatmakers. Becker, sadly, passed away from esophageal cancer on September 3 at age 67. But his music lives on—and continues to find new audiences—through the many hip-hop, rock, and R&amp;B tracks collected here.Grant Hart’s Greatest SongsWith ’80s noise-pop pioneers Husker Dü, Grant Hart played the misfit McCartney to Bob Mould’s lacerating Lennon, providing the honey chaser to his partner’s hoarse-throat howls. Following the band’s extremely acrimonious break-up, Hart gradually faded into obscurity, releasing a small handful of under-the-radar records while Mould enjoyed a steady, successful career as an alt-rock elder statesman. Recent years had been especially trying: Hart lost both parents in quick succession, and he was injured in a fire that destroyed his longtime family home in South St. Paul. And then 2017 brought the diagnosis of the kidney cancer that ultimately claimed him on September 14 at the age of 56. With this playlist, we pay tribute to the man who forged the Dave Grohl prototype of the shit-hot drummer who also a tender tunesmith.Tom Petty RememberedBefore his death from cardiac arrest on October 2 at age 66, Tom Petty was a man of the people in a way that Dylan and Springsteen couldn’t be, because they just seemed too oversized, too mythic, too huge from the get-go. Like the characters he tended to write about, Petty was always somewhere between underdog and self-made outcast. Yet the chip on his shoulder was the rare and beautiful kind that seemed to make him more empathetic to people rather than less so. That’s what you hear in these songs, some of which are hits, while others are deep cuts from albums that didn’t quite get as much love as they should’ve. (For more, check out this playlist of the contemporary artists keeping Petty’s spirit alive.)The Non-Canadian’s Guide to Understanding Gord DownieGord Downie was effectively Canada’s Bruce Springsteen—a rock star with blue-collar blood, whose intimate portraits of Canadian life could stir a patriotic fervor with a simple small-town namedrop. His band, The Tragically Hip, was huge in Canada and in Canada only, however, since Downie’s untimely passing from brain cancer on October 18 at age 53, more people outside the country are tuning into his peculiar genius. Here’s a playlist of 23 songs to introduce non-Canadian newcomers to Downie’s deep discography. While it includes some Hip hits, these aren’t necessarily the band’s most popular songs. Rather, they’re ones that mostly venture beyond the band’s bar-rock roots and don’t require an Encyclopedia Canadiana to decode. And they’re the ones that most directly communicate Downie’s singular combination of outsized passion, white-knuckled intensity, sly humor, absurdity… and grace, too.AC/DC’s Greatest Riffs (Non-Hits Edition)If his brother, Angus, is AC/DC’s Chuck Berry (all about dazzling flashes of lightning and speeding, razor-wire licks) then Malcolm Young was their Bo Diddley, a brilliant groove engineer (as well as songwriter—let’s not forget that) who could ceaselessly combine and recombine the essential, fundamental components of boogie. We present a cannonballed salute to the greatest rhythm guitarist in hard rock, who passed away November 18 at age 64 after a years-long struggle with dementia.</summary>

The producer, DJ, promoter, remixer, and proud Scot has amassed a catalog that directly mirrors the freely flowing exchange between DIY, anything-goes rock and cutting-edge dance music that has long defined the country’s underground. After all, Scottish artists were some of the very first on the planet to (1) blend punk and discoid propulsion (see Fire Engines’ 1980 landmark “Get Up and Use Me”), (2) fold alt-rock into house/techno (Primal Scream, of course), and (3) pioneer ’00s dance rock (the crazy prescient Yummy Fur did it a decade ahead of schedule).Among the slew of vinyl Twitch released in 2016 (including those sides on the Optimo Trax and Optimo Music Disco Plate sub-labels), it’s on The Pussy Mothers’ &lt;em&gt;The Number 1 EP&lt;/em&gt;, MR TC’s &lt;em&gt;Surf and Destroy&lt;/em&gt;, and Junto Club’s &lt;em&gt;Warm Me Up&lt;/em&gt; that these deliciously anarchic qualities are most in your face. &lt;em&gt;Surf and Destroy&lt;/em&gt; is especially telling: the title track is a throbbing orgy of acid squelch, post-punk atmosphere, and psychedelic guitar wash.In contrast, these qualities become more subtle on those records that (at first blush, at least) tilt more toward orthodox dancefloor groove. A track like “In Turbine,” from Underspreche’s &lt;em&gt;Invito Alla Danza Part 1&lt;/em&gt;, is minimal, electroacoustic drone rock (complete with warm organ hum) from a duo who are no strangers to pounding club jams. Noo is another revealing example: Their &lt;em&gt;Optimo Music Disco Plate Five&lt;/em&gt; is all about 21st-century Italo awesomeness filtered through a scrappy, slacker basement vibe. Noo, it has to be noted, was founded by Christophe “Daze” Dasen and Sami Liuski, who hail from Switzerland and Finland respectively. You see, that’s a part of Twitch’s curatorial genius; he possesses a knack for teaming up with artists who, while they may not hail from the Scottish underground, create music that totally reflects its unique sensibility.Note: while my playlist is stacked with tracks from Optimo Music’s 2016 releases, listeners will also discover a handful of older gems. Truth be told, the label’s full catalog is never far from my turntable. For example, I probably jam Golden Teacher’s &lt;em&gt;Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night&lt;/em&gt; — a boisterous collision of future punk, acid, and all manner of tribal funkery released in 2013 — at least once a month.

After a fit of false starts and head fakes, Ocean revealed his masterpiece, &lt;em&gt;Blonde&lt;/em&gt;, an album that, in many ways, embodied a greater idea of what America could be: inclusive and diverse, both culturally and aesthetically; adventurous and transparent, embracing experimentations in search of an emotional honesty; and, not least importantly, fun, and filled with an overarching optimism.Things may have gone downhill since then, but we still have Frank, and he’s been particularly productive in 2017, releasing a slew of more pop-oriented singles, and, maybe just as importantly, curating his own radio show, &lt;em&gt;blonded&lt;/em&gt;, on Apple Music. Ocean has never been particularly forthcoming in interviews—on the few occasions he’s done them—but his taste in music offers a rare and deep glimpse into his creative processes and inspirations.For many, Ocean’s music is singular, and his talent and sound seem to have emerged from a vacuum, but there are specific antecedents to each component of his music. Like many music masterminds—from Prince to Radiohead—he’s interested in genre pastiche, extracting and recontextualizing broad and seemingly disparate forms of music. Listening to these broadcasts is like watching a master chef at work in their kitchen.We’ve combined and organized selections that Frank picked for &lt;em&gt;blonded&lt;/em&gt;, as well as previous lists he’s provided over the years and the music that he’s sampled, dividing the playlists largely along genre lines in order to provide a key for how Frank thinks about music. The main playlist here represents a megamix of all the tracks featured in the segmented playlists below. (You can access the original &lt;em&gt;blonded&lt;/em&gt; podcast by visiting Apple Music, or &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/third_bridge_creative"&gt;subscribing to our Spotify channel&lt;/a&gt;, where we’re collected them as Spotify playlists.)&lt;strong&gt;FRANK’S AMBIENT/ELECTRONIC/GLITCH ITCH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/third_bridge_creative/playlist/2x2J2HCBf9g7yCXRjRrybn"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank Ocean’s video performance piece &lt;em&gt;Endless &lt;/em&gt;was a teaser “album” of sorts, released just one day before &lt;em&gt;Blonde&lt;/em&gt;. With the visuals’ stark, high-contrast lighting, and the tracks’ broken soundscapes and fractured melodies, it was an immersive and frequently confounding experience. There were certainly songs there—the Isley Brothers/Aaliyah cover “(At Your Best) You Are Love” remains one of the most haunting tracks Ocean has released—but for the most part, the piece was focused on generating a skeletal, unsettling, and haunting atmosphere. This vibe was carried over to the creeping sounds of &lt;em&gt;Blonde&lt;/em&gt; tracks “Seigfried” and “Futura Free.”This focus on textures over tunes is the common denominator for most of the tracks on this playlist. A beautiful, gentle piano melody emerges from the skittering beats of Aphex Twin’s “Flim.” Todd Rundgren’s 1970 proto-ambient work “There Are No Words,” meanwhile, moves like fog—eerie, otherworldly, and all-encompassing. Rundgren’s other contribution to this playlist, his 1973 track “Flamingo”—sampled on Ocean’s track “Solo”—is comparatively less whispy, with chirping birth noises fluttering around a circular synth figure. It’s no surprise to see Arca here; the Venezuelan queer performance artist and Kanye/Björk producer has been mining the same space between operatic melodrama and jarring ambient noise as Ocean did on &lt;em&gt;Endless&lt;/em&gt; and the last half of &lt;em&gt;Blonde&lt;/em&gt;. The tracks here do occasionally gain momentum —with French maverick Sébastien Tellier’s reflective 3 a.m. anthem “La ritournelle” in particular—but, for the most part, the music here serves as a pensive, ambient mood board.&lt;strong&gt;Further Listening&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/decoding-endless-frank-oceans-wild-years/"&gt;Decoding Endless: Frank’s Wild Years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/best-ambient-techno/"&gt;The Best Ambient Techno&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/the-50-best-ambient-albums-of-all-time/"&gt;The 50 Best Ambient Albums of All Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/aphex-twins-field-day/"&gt;Aphex Twin’s Field Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUNDAY-MORNING HEARTBREAK AND SOFT R&amp;amp;B JAMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/third_bridge_creative/playlist/5WvnuuEUIX9a1RDmaIpeYL"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a warmth and intimacy to many of Frank Ocean’s best tracks—think of the delicate dance of “Pink + White” from &lt;em&gt;Blonde&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Channel Orange &lt;/em&gt;tracks like “Bad Religion,” the bouncy “Monks,” or the titantic “Thinkin’ About You.” The Rhodes-driven tracks reference, of course, the classic R&amp;amp;B of Stevie Wonder, but they also point towards another, more modern and gentle strand of R&amp;amp;B that descended from neo-soul forebearers such as Erykah Badu and D’Angelo. Esperanza Spalding (who Frank included on &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/third_bridge_creative/playlist/1TYdZfp5eKEn5CmCrO3NAZ"&gt;inaugural edition of &lt;em&gt;blonded&lt;/em&gt; radio&lt;/a&gt;) is a great example of this, skirting the borders of jazz, funk, and soul and paying homage to each, but carving out a singular aesthetic that’s both modern and timeless.The best tracks here are those that negotiate traditional genre boundaries with a gentle grace. Yussef Kamaal’s “Yo Chavez” interweaves vibe-laced ‘70s jazz fusion with a shuffling broken beat over airy textures that points towards the looser, groovier parts of &lt;em&gt;Channel Orange&lt;/em&gt;. The classic boom-bap funk fuzz of the OutKast/Erykah Badu collaboration “Humble Mumble,” or the loose, euphoric glow of Kehlani’s “Undercover,” also reflects the warmth of Ocean’s “Pink + White,” while Darando’s raggedy falsetto on the forgotten ‘70s classic “Didn’t I” (originally included on &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/third_bridge_creative/playlist/2uLcCKAGHrMcXWrDBBqMc2"&gt;installment five of &lt;em&gt;blonded&lt;/em&gt; radio)&lt;/a&gt; is endlessly fragile and haunting. These are deeply intimate love songs, but most of these capture a love interrupted, deferred, or forgotten—a confessional focus that Ocean has returned to time and time again throughout his career.This is perfect Sunday morning listening, but it’s pretty damn good for any day (or time) you want to push play.&lt;strong&gt;Further Listening:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/raphael-saadiq-behind-scenes/"&gt;Raphael Saadiq Behind the Scenes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/sza/"&gt;Why SZA’s CTRL Is the R&amp;amp;B Album of the Summer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/solange-unpacked/"&gt;Unpacked: Solange’s A Seat at the Table&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FRANK’S RAP TRAX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/third_bridge_creative/playlist/7ctgVOq0vfDQ1SBH5JwIlh"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many ways, Frank Ocean is less invested in rap music than his R&amp;amp;B peers. When he listed out &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/third_bridge_creative/playlist/7BeFR0JPpGeD5tMXxPOHwQ"&gt;his favorite tracks&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;Blonde&lt;/em&gt; magazine last year, hip-hop was absent save for an OutKast and, um, DRAM track. And while Ocean has &lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/frank-ocean-guest-spots/"&gt;provided guest turns on a number of tracks&lt;/a&gt;—and he actually raps on Earl Sweatshirt’s lazy, SoCal anthem “Sunday”—he’s not nearly as promiscuous as other singers, and, as frequently as not, he tilts the gravity of the track so that they become Frank Ocean songs. (Kanye, wisely realizing this, stripped his contribution from the end of &lt;em&gt;The Life of Pablo&lt;/em&gt;’s “Wolves” and made it its own track, the appropriately entitled “Frank’s Track.”)Still, Frank is deeply invested in the genre, both through his Odd Future lineage and in rap’s culture, sound, and attitude. The hip-hop tracks that he’s included on &lt;em&gt;blonded&lt;/em&gt; radio (episodes &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/third_bridge_creative/playlist/3GnujLLnXTxkKwaawEIX0q"&gt;#4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/third_bridge_creative/playlist/53VUjp4mm5bB2xwJjDmqhj"&gt;#6 &lt;/a&gt;focus on the genre) and beyond tend to be chart-driven singles, and remind us that Ocean is ultimately a pop artist. The hypnotic “Tunnel Vision” from Kodak Black has this year’s best use of the flute (and, really, &lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/songs-prove-flute-always-hip-hops-secret-weapon/"&gt;that’s saying a lot&lt;/a&gt;) and matches the loopy, hall-of-mirrors vibe of many Ocean tracks. And while Frank famously called out the Grammys for giving Album of the Year to Taylor Swift over Kendrick—&lt;a href="https://genius.com/a/frank-ocean-denounces-the-grammys-for-giving-taylor-swift-album-of-the-year-over-kendrick-lamar"&gt;"hands down one of the most 'faulty’ TV moments I've seen"&lt;/a&gt;—that’s not the only thing linking Lamar and Ocean. Both endlessly distort and manipulate their voices: Kendrick changes registers, effects, and pitch with nearly every verse, while Ocean—on tracks like “Nikes”—uses vocal mutations to add both texture and narrative drama to his tracks. It wasn’t surprising that he included “LUST.” on &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/third_bridge_creative/playlist/3GnujLLnXTxkKwaawEIX0q"&gt;installment #4&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;blonded&lt;/em&gt;.But, more than any aesthetic linkage, these guys are his friends (A$AP Rocky), his collaborators (Future), and his idols (OutKast), and this playlist acknowledges those influences and associations.&lt;strong&gt;Further Listening:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/kendrick-lamars-damn-unpacked/"&gt;Kendrick Lamar’s &lt;em&gt;DAMN.&lt;/em&gt;, Unpacked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/frank-ocean-guest-spots/"&gt;Frank Ocean’s Best Guest Spots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/songs-prove-flute-always-hip-hops-secret-weapon/"&gt;Songs That Prove the Flute Was Always Hip-Hop’s Secret Weapon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FRANK’S INDIE ROCK FIXATION &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/third_bridge_creative/playlist/2YMlh2DGIibXkeNtr2v8yC"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Indie rock” is a bit of a misnomer. It always has been&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;It’s more of a philosophical approach or psychographic than it is an aesthetic designation, but, however you look at it, Frank Ocean has long been a rabid fan of this spectrum of music. The surf-rock guitar line that anchors “Ivy” wouldn’t have felt out of place on any number of ‘60s-revivalist rock records from the past decade, while the clamour and noise of “Pretty Sweet” sound a lot like the psych/lo-fi groups that populated the ’90s rock landscape (though, granted, the two-step/garage drum line at the end turns it into a Frank Ocean track), while the bouncy melodies and sullen vocal counterpoints owe more than a little to The Smiths.There’s been a long-standing tradition of indie-rock critics trying to project their own music onto R&amp;amp;B and hip-hop musicians, and that’s not what we’re trying to do here—but it’s also undeniable that Frank has focused a lot on this type of music (particularly on &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/third_bridge_creative/playlist/2uLcCKAGHrMcXWrDBBqMc2"&gt;the fifth edition of blonded radio&lt;/a&gt;). Some of the selections here are exactly the songs you’d expect from someone who spends his summers headlining festivals—MGMT’s “Electric Feel,” The Flaming Lips’ “Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots”—but others convey a deeper investment. Suicide’s “Frankie Teardrop” reflects Ocean’s own penchant for creating long-form, mise-en-scene narratives over noisy, clattering backdrops, even if Alan Vega’s tale of a down-and-out factory worker killing his family is a little more macabre than anything on Frank’s albums. The shimmering, ephemeral “Wild Thing Runs Free” from Baltimore noise-punk group Teen Suicide resembles the rambling interludes that dot Frank’s own albums. And it’s not surprising to see (Sandy) Alex G show up on the &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/third_bridge_creative/playlist/39cW2ipXd2xYgHk0Jo6q9W"&gt;second edition of &lt;em&gt;blonded&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—after all, he did contribute guitar work to both &lt;em&gt;Endless&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Blonde&lt;/em&gt;—and his track “Mis” is imbued with a certain shambolic majesty.We don’t want Frank to abandon custom luxury cars and glitter for stick-and-poke tattoos and dive bars, but this is a great, revealing, and fairly unexpected playlist.&lt;strong&gt;Further Listening:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/ambient-dream-folk-beyond/"&gt;Ambient Dream Folk &amp;amp; Beyond &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/the-best-of-kranky-records/"&gt;Dreamy Noise Sounds: The Best of Kranky Records&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/fierce-fuzzy-lo-fi-revolution/"&gt;Fierce and Fuzzy: The Lo-Fi Revolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="380" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7j7MxelhXCyl86HmZu0Nnk?utm_source=generator" style="border-radius:12px" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <summary>We may have reached a sort of peak America on August 20, 2016. After a fit of false starts and head fakes, Ocean revealed his masterpiece, Blonde, an album that, in many ways, embodied a greater idea of what America could be: inclusive and diverse, both culturally and aesthetically; adventurous and transparent, embracing experimentations in search of an emotional honesty; and, not least importantly, fun, and filled with an overarching optimism.Things may have gone downhill since then, but we still have Frank, and he’s been particularly productive in 2017, releasing a slew of more pop-oriented singles, and, maybe just as importantly, curating his own radio show, blonded, on Apple Music. Ocean has never been particularly forthcoming in interviews—on the few occasions he’s done them—but his taste in music offers a rare and deep glimpse into his creative processes and inspirations.For many, Ocean’s music is singular, and his talent and sound seem to have emerged from a vacuum, but there are specific antecedents to each component of his music. Like many music masterminds—from Prince to Radiohead—he’s interested in genre pastiche, extracting and recontextualizing broad and seemingly disparate forms of music. Listening to these broadcasts is like watching a master chef at work in their kitchen.We’ve combined and organized selections that Frank picked for blonded, as well as previous lists he’s provided over the years and the music that he’s sampled, dividing the playlists largely along genre lines in order to provide a key for how Frank thinks about music. The main playlist here represents a megamix of all the tracks featured in the segmented playlists below. (You can access the original blonded podcast by visiting Apple Music, or subscribing to our Spotify channel, where we’re collected them as Spotify playlists.)FRANK’S AMBIENT/ELECTRONIC/GLITCH ITCHFrank Ocean’s video performance piece Endless was a teaser “album” of sorts, released just one day before Blonde. With the visuals’ stark, high-contrast lighting, and the tracks’ broken soundscapes and fractured melodies, it was an immersive and frequently confounding experience. There were certainly songs there—the Isley Brothers/Aaliyah cover “(At Your Best) You Are Love” remains one of the most haunting tracks Ocean has released—but for the most part, the piece was focused on generating a skeletal, unsettling, and haunting atmosphere. This vibe was carried over to the creeping sounds of Blonde tracks “Seigfried” and “Futura Free.”This focus on textures over tunes is the common denominator for most of the tracks on this playlist. A beautiful, gentle piano melody emerges from the skittering beats of Aphex Twin’s “Flim.” Todd Rundgren’s 1970 proto-ambient work “There Are No Words,” meanwhile, moves like fog—eerie, otherworldly, and all-encompassing. Rundgren’s other contribution to this playlist, his 1973 track “Flamingo”—sampled on Ocean’s track “Solo”—is comparatively less whispy, with chirping birth noises fluttering around a circular synth figure. It’s no surprise to see Arca here; the Venezuelan queer performance artist and Kanye/Björk producer has been mining the same space between operatic melodrama and jarring ambient noise as Ocean did on Endless and the last half of Blonde. The tracks here do occasionally gain momentum —with French maverick Sébastien Tellier’s reflective 3 a.m. anthem “La ritournelle” in particular—but, for the most part, the music here serves as a pensive, ambient mood board.Further Listening:Decoding Endless: Frank’s Wild YearsThe Best Ambient TechnoThe 50 Best Ambient Albums of All TimeAphex Twin’s Field DaySUNDAY-MORNING HEARTBREAK AND SOFT R&amp;B JAMSThere’s a warmth and intimacy to many of Frank Ocean’s best tracks—think of the delicate dance of “Pink + White” from Blonde, or Channel Orange tracks like “Bad Religion,” the bouncy “Monks,” or the titantic “Thinkin’ About You.” The Rhodes-driven tracks reference, of course, the classic R&amp;B of Stevie Wonder, but they also point towards another, more modern and gentle strand of R&amp;B that descended from neo-soul forebearers such as Erykah Badu and D’Angelo. Esperanza Spalding (who Frank included on inaugural edition of blonded radio) is a great example of this, skirting the borders of jazz, funk, and soul and paying homage to each, but carving out a singular aesthetic that’s both modern and timeless.The best tracks here are those that negotiate traditional genre boundaries with a gentle grace. Yussef Kamaal’s “Yo Chavez” interweaves vibe-laced ‘70s jazz fusion with a shuffling broken beat over airy textures that points towards the looser, groovier parts of Channel Orange. The classic boom-bap funk fuzz of the OutKast/Erykah Badu collaboration “Humble Mumble,” or the loose, euphoric glow of Kehlani’s “Undercover,” also reflects the warmth of Ocean’s “Pink + White,” while Darando’s raggedy falsetto on the forgotten ‘70s classic “Didn’t I” (originally included on installment five of blonded radio) is endlessly fragile and haunting. These are deeply intimate love songs, but most of these capture a love interrupted, deferred, or forgotten—a confessional focus that Ocean has returned to time and time again throughout his career.This is perfect Sunday morning listening, but it’s pretty damn good for any day (or time) you want to push play.Further Listening:Raphael Saadiq Behind the ScenesWhy SZA’s CTRL Is the R&amp;B Album of the SummerUnpacked: Solange’s A Seat at the TableFRANK’S RAP TRAXIn many ways, Frank Ocean is less invested in rap music than his R&amp;B peers. When he listed out his favorite tracks for the Blonde magazine last year, hip-hop was absent save for an OutKast and, um, DRAM track. And while Ocean has provided guest turns on a number of tracks—and he actually raps on Earl Sweatshirt’s lazy, SoCal anthem “Sunday”—he’s not nearly as promiscuous as other singers, and, as frequently as not, he tilts the gravity of the track so that they become Frank Ocean songs. (Kanye, wisely realizing this, stripped his contribution from the end of The Life of Pablo’s “Wolves” and made it its own track, the appropriately entitled “Frank’s Track.”)Still, Frank is deeply invested in the genre, both through his Odd Future lineage and in rap’s culture, sound, and attitude. The hip-hop tracks that he’s included on blonded radio (episodes #4 and #6 focus on the genre) and beyond tend to be chart-driven singles, and remind us that Ocean is ultimately a pop artist. The hypnotic “Tunnel Vision” from Kodak Black has this year’s best use of the flute (and, really, that’s saying a lot) and matches the loopy, hall-of-mirrors vibe of many Ocean tracks. And while Frank famously called out the Grammys for giving Album of the Year to Taylor Swift over Kendrick—"hands down one of the most 'faulty’ TV moments I've seen"—that’s not the only thing linking Lamar and Ocean. Both endlessly distort and manipulate their voices: Kendrick changes registers, effects, and pitch with nearly every verse, while Ocean—on tracks like “Nikes”—uses vocal mutations to add both texture and narrative drama to his tracks. It wasn’t surprising that he included “LUST.” on installment #4 of blonded.But, more than any aesthetic linkage, these guys are his friends (A$AP Rocky), his collaborators (Future), and his idols (OutKast), and this playlist acknowledges those influences and associations.Further Listening:Kendrick Lamar’s DAMN., UnpackedFrank Ocean’s Best Guest SpotsSongs That Prove the Flute Was Always Hip-Hop’s Secret WeaponFRANK’S INDIE ROCK FIXATION “Indie rock” is a bit of a misnomer.

Contrary to the belief held by some that the conductor is a largely dispensable figure who shows up, waves his or her arms for a few hours, and then takes home a big paycheck, the conductor is often the hardest-working member of the orchestra. A great conductor trains for decades to become great, usually mastering at least one instrument at the highest level. Along the way, he or she achieves a thorough knowledge of music history, a mastery of music theory, and an encyclopedic knowledge of how instruments work.Indeed, the conductor has to know each instrument’s part better than its own player does, and must understand how each of those parts can be best actualized. The conductor spends months learning 100-plus page scores, sometimes even memorizing them, in advance of orchestra rehearsals, which occur in the weeks before a performance. While studying the score, the conductor uses their years of experience and knowledge to interpret its contents, drawing from academic literature as well as recorded music to make executive decisions about phrasing, tempo, dynamics, rhythm, temporality, balance, and countless other aspects. In this sense, every performance of a work is a unique interpretation, even if, on the surface, many sound the same. Once the conductor shows up on stage on the night of the concert, he or she has spent many hours rehearsing that night’s piece with the orchestra, who will be playing, for better or worse, the way the conductor has instructed them to.Conductors are also responsible for selecting the music their orchestra plays, and the ones on this list—compiled by the BBC’s &lt;a href="http://classical-music.com"&gt;classical-music.com&lt;/a&gt; site—have surely been indispensable to the unfolding of music history over the past century. Mahler, for example, may never have become popular in the United States if Leonard Bernstein hadn’t obsessed over his music in the 1960s, producing the first complete recorded cycle of the composer’s symphonies. Nikolaus Harnoncourt and John Eliot Gardiner are both well-known for their important contributions not only to recorded music, but to the scholarship, advancing philosophies of historical performance practice and often insisting that their ensembles use historically accurate instruments. These two conductors seek to deliver interpretations that come from tireless academic study of both the source material and the conventions of its time period. Pierre Boulez was an austere conductor whose interpretations of modern and postmodern music cut to the chase, favoring transparency and clarity over large romantic gestures; some called him cold, while others said he was second-to-none in putting the emphasis on the musical material instead of catering to the emotions of the audience. Point being: Conductors are often (but not always!) rich thinkers who make important decisions about how, when, where, and why we hear music.We should take this list as authoritative, since the BBC polled 100 of the most important living conductors to create it, from Vladimir Ashkenazy to Michael Tilson Thomas. Fans of classical music have argued for years over the qualities and failures of this or that performance or recording, often descending into semantic insanity; however, few would argue that anyone on this list isn’t great. Use this playlist as a jumping-off point to venture forth and decide for yourself: Do you prefer Kleiber’s Brahms 4, or Harnoncourt’s? Furtwängler’s Bruckner 8, or Boulez’s? For Mahler: Bernstein or Abbado? Ultimately everyone has their own opinion of which conductor is the greatest, but the experts have spoken, and these are their selections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="380" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/6M4y4OTP0aZoBz3HFNq9kF?utm_source=generator" style="border-radius:12px" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

Contrary to the belief held by some that the conductor is a largely dispensable figure who shows up, waves his or her arms for a few hours, and then takes home a big paycheck, the conductor is often the hardest-working member of the orchestra. A great conductor trains for decades to become great, usually mastering at least one instrument at the highest level. Along the way, he or she achieves a thorough knowledge of music history, a mastery of music theory, and an encyclopedic knowledge of how instruments work.Indeed, the conductor has to know each instrument’s part better than its own player does, and must understand how each of those parts can be best actualized. The conductor spends months learning 100-plus page scores, sometimes even memorizing them, in advance of orchestra rehearsals, which occur in the weeks before a performance. While studying the score, the conductor uses their years of experience and knowledge to interpret its contents, drawing from academic literature as well as recorded music to make executive decisions about phrasing, tempo, dynamics, rhythm, temporality, balance, and countless other aspects. In this sense, every performance of a work is a unique interpretation, even if, on the surface, many sound the same. Once the conductor shows up on stage on the night of the concert, he or she has spent many hours rehearsing that night’s piece with the orchestra, who will be playing, for better or worse, the way the conductor has instructed them to.Conductors are also responsible for selecting the music their orchestra plays, and the ones on this list—compiled by the BBC’s classical-music.com site—have surely been indispensable to the unfolding of music history over the past century. Mahler, for example, may never have become popular in the United States if Leonard Bernstein hadn’t obsessed over his music in the 1960s, producing the first complete recorded cycle of the composer’s symphonies. Nikolaus Harnoncourt and John Eliot Gardiner are both well-known for their important contributions not only to recorded music, but to the scholarship, advancing philosophies of historical performance practice and often insisting that their ensembles use historically accurate instruments. These two conductors seek to deliver interpretations that come from tireless academic study of both the source material and the conventions of its time period. Pierre Boulez was an austere conductor whose interpretations of modern and postmodern music cut to the chase, favoring transparency and clarity over large romantic gestures; some called him cold, while others said he was second-to-none in putting the emphasis on the musical material instead of catering to the emotions of the audience. Point being: Conductors are often (but not always!) rich thinkers who make important decisions about how, when, where, and why we hear music.We should take this list as authoritative, since the BBC polled 100 of the most important living conductors to create it, from Vladimir Ashkenazy to Michael Tilson Thomas. Fans of classical music have argued for years over the qualities and failures of this or that performance or recording, often descending into semantic insanity; however, few would argue that anyone on this list isn’t great. Use this playlist as a jumping-off point to venture forth and decide for yourself: Do you prefer Kleiber’s Brahms 4, or Harnoncourt’s? Furtwängler’s Bruckner 8, or Boulez’s? For Mahler: Bernstein or Abbado? Ultimately everyone has their own opinion of which conductor is the greatest, but the experts have spoken, and these are their selections.</summary>

However, the ’90s turned that theory on its head. Its big-bang moment—Nirvana’s &lt;em&gt;Nevermind&lt;/em&gt;—occurred very early in the decade, sending shockwaves through the mainstream and underground alike, and transforming “alt-” into an all-purpose badge of outsider cool that could be affixed to anything from country to hip-hop.

It was also arguably the last era when certified weirdos like Royal Trux, Mercury Rev, and Mike Watt could be given free rein on a major-label budget, and the last moment when one could credibly hold on to the sincere beliefs that Pavement had crossover potential and Sonic Youth was a logical Lollapalooza headliner.

In hindsight, the year portended the era of fragmentation we currently inhabit, as what initially felt like a generational movement became corporatized or broken down into subcultural niches.

Four decades later, this single year of music continually haunts us with its greatness through deaths and rebirths, reissues, and reunion tours. With the Sex Pistols’ &lt;em&gt;Never Mind the Bollocks…&lt;/em&gt;, the Ramones’ &lt;em&gt;Rocket to Russia&lt;/em&gt; AND &lt;em&gt;Leave Home&lt;/em&gt;, and The Clash’s self-titled album, it was a major year for punk; through Television’s &lt;em&gt;Marquee Moon&lt;/em&gt; and Wire’s &lt;em&gt;Pink Flag&lt;/em&gt;, we glimpsed the dawn of post-punk. And I, for one, still don’t know what to call Iggy Pop’s dual masterpieces from that year, &lt;em&gt;The Idiot&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lust for Life&lt;/em&gt;, two records that strayed far enough outside the conventions of rock, proto-punk, and post-punk that they should maybe just be left under the art-rock banner. Likewise, Suicide’s ghostly, self-titled classic could be called anything from proto-punk to post-punk to synth-pop; its mercurial nature only amplifies its staying power as we continue to struggle to digest it in light of Alan Vega’s 2016 death.Also along the lines of the weirder, more avant-garde pop: David Bowie (who produced Iggy Pop’s two releases from that year) dropped Berlin-trilogy classics &lt;em&gt;”Heroes”&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Low&lt;/em&gt;—the latter produced by Brian Eno, whose own &lt;em&gt;Before and After Science&lt;/em&gt; came out that December. These records, alongside &lt;em&gt;Talking Heads: 77&lt;/em&gt;, Kraftwerk’s &lt;em&gt;Trans-Europe Express&lt;/em&gt;, and Elvis Costello’s debut LP, &lt;em&gt;My Aim Is True&lt;/em&gt;, pointed clearly and forcefully toward the New Wave of the ‘80s.Nineteen-seventy-seven also saw rock continuing to explode into a vast diaspora of sub-genres: disillusioned folk rock (Neil Young’s &lt;em&gt;American Stars ‘n Bars&lt;/em&gt;, Fleetwood Mac’s &lt;em&gt;Rumours&lt;/em&gt;), politicized prog rock (Pink Floyd’s &lt;em&gt;Animals&lt;/em&gt;), country-inflected jam rock (Grateful Dead’s &lt;em&gt;Terrapin Station&lt;/em&gt;), smooth jazz rock (Steely Dan’s &lt;em&gt;Aja&lt;/em&gt;), and whatever you’d call Billy Joel’s &lt;em&gt;The Stranger&lt;/em&gt;. (Oh yeah, and John Williams’ &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack came out.)This (incomplete, to be sure) list has probably inspired thoughts of nostalgia, as well as, possibly, some feelings of melancholy about the music of our own time. If strong opinions about any of these records have surfaced, it’s because 1977 is still very alive today. The year still guides the rock we make, and it still infiltrates our playlists. The political and social issues of 1977 still, in many ways, exist, and we still struggle to respond to them in ways that are appropriate and meaningful. This playlist isn’t going to change the world, but if it leads to a new way of understanding the present, that’s a good thing. Or, if you just jam out to it while cleaning your house or going for a run, that’s fine, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="380" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/3cLpbPDcaI2HEjTBi17DmD?utm_source=generator" style="border-radius:12px" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

(Oh yeah, and John Williams’ Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope soundtrack came out.)This (incomplete, to be sure) list has probably inspired thoughts of nostalgia, as well as, possibly, some feelings of melancholy about the music of our own time. If strong opinions about any of these records have surfaced, it’s because 1977 is still very alive today. The year still guides the rock we make, and it still infiltrates our playlists. The political and social issues of 1977 still, in many ways, exist, and we still struggle to respond to them in ways that are appropriate and meaningful. This playlist isn’t going to change the world, but if it leads to a new way of understanding the present, that’s a good thing. Or, if you just jam out to it while cleaning your house or going for a run, that’s fine, too.</summary>

Since the first LCD Soundsystem reunion show was announced at the start of 2016, James Murphy spent the next year doing exactly what he told everyone he wouldn’t do: cashing in on the residual fervor generated by his past success, and on the reunion economy at large. Its in this transitional period of Murphy’s career that his playlist for the Ten Songs That Saved Your Life site (he actually chose 15*) take on a new context. His list includes the obvious forebearers of traditional rock, LES post-punk, and quintessential European electronica. They are highly indicative of his own music, which has often subtly reimagined sounds already thought to have hit their apex. But keep in mind that on this mix, Murphy is not flaunting his inspiration; he’s talking salvation. So much of his music has dressed itself in sardonic humour before it sucks all the air out of the room with its unabashed honesty. It’s a skill that the best of the best share. Whether it’s coming from Roberta Flack or David Bowie, there is something both comforting and emancipatory about someone else speaking your truth better than you ever could. Perhaps this is why Murphy’s own resurgence has been so unnervingly easy to swallow. When artists are this impressive, sometimes catalyzing entire subgenres through their work, it’s difficult to argue why you shouldn’t pedestalize them. On the other hand, it makes it similarly easy to give them a pass when they get under your skin.&lt;em&gt;* Some of Murphys selections are not available on Spotify and thus not included on this playlist.

By nature, playlist-making is a highly personal process, an opportunity for anyone to play the role of radio programmer and tailor their song selection to suit a particular mood, activity, or obsession. Increasingly, we’ve seen them become a more communal medium, whether it’s bands releasing a curated mix to hype a new record, streaming services using them to break new artists, fans crowd-sourcing set lists to create shareable post-show souvenirs, or one of the biggest rappers in the world taking the “playlists are the new albums” mantra literally. But in 2017, we also saw playlists that moved beyond the realm of the promotional to the political, be it through pointed statements or charity initiatives. It may still feel strange to think a playlist could change the world, but in 2017, the act of dragging-and-dropping reached new levels of artistry, activitism, and influence.1. &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZEVXcTPuWzCOuXB8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Discover Weekly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spotify’s Discover Weekly playlist was launched in July of 2015, but with the music service now boasting more than 60 million paying subscribers and playlists eclipsing albums as the dominant way fans consume music, the weekly personalized mix is more relevant than ever. Essentially based on the concept of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering"&gt;collaborative filtering&lt;/a&gt;, the algorithm looks at songs it knows you like, then recommends you songs adjacent to those songs in other users’ playlists and libraries. The result is often uncannily precient recommendations. If you’ve become as addicted to this playlist as so many others, there’s good news: The more users Spotify adds, the more data there is to mine, and the better these recommendations get. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZEVXcTPuWzCOuXB8"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX0XUsuxWHRQd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RapCaviar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In 2017, RapCavier was the &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; of playlists. It &lt;a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DF9ICzdb1e4/WYzCNQS1D-I/AAAAAAACmWc/i5VQnL4yMb4PWndedEa8Vi9TcKpI7UsPACLcBGAs/s800/rap%2Bcaviar%2Ball%2Bcaps%2Bspotify%2Bbillboard.jpg"&gt;adorned billboards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7972951/spotify-chicago-rapcaviar-live-concert-series-lil-uzi-vert"&gt;spawned its own tour,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://trackrecord.net/spotifys-rapcaviar-picks-the-hits-of-today-youll-neve-1820987911"&gt;stirred up controversy&lt;/a&gt;, and turned its creator, Tuma Basa, into an industry celebrity. It’s easy to be cynical about it all, but also very difficult to turn away. Week after week, it simply delivered the goods, helping break an entire new generation of rap artists (it’s no coincidence that Lil Uzi Vert headlined the tour) while also being one of the first playlists to incorporate video. In an era that was supposed to have decimated the tastemaker class, Basa and his playlist provided essential listening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX0XUsuxWHRQd"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/drakes-new-playlist-drakes-best-album/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drake, &lt;em&gt;More Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is among the best of Drake’s clumping-tracks-together things, and that’s very much because &lt;em&gt;More Life&lt;/em&gt; is consciously a “playlist.” This isn’t a low-stakes gambit or a cheap marketing gimmick (at least not entirely), but an honest engagement with a new form. &lt;em&gt;More Life&lt;/em&gt; is loose and meandering, and sometimes the individual components seem slight and tertiary. But like the best playlists, it captures a moment, a feeling, and a place. &lt;em&gt;More Life&lt;/em&gt; is enjoyable and, as anyone who listens to a lot of classic albums knows, enjoying music trumps appreciating it—and this release is infinitely better than any other non-sweater-meme Drake release in years. For that, we can thank the generations of mixtape compilers, playlist curators, radio DJs, and compilation creators for helping define this new form. But, most of all, we should thank Drake for getting that the lines between artist, audience, critic, and curator are porous, and for making an initial foray into what this intersection looks like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1lXY618HWkwYKJWBRYR4MK"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/grim-kims-150-raddest-metal-albums-ever-made-people-happen-not-dudes/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grim Kim’s 150 Raddest Metal Albums Ever Made by People Who Happen To Not Be Dude&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This past July, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/07/24/538387823/turning-the-tables-150-greatest-albums-made-by-women"&gt;NPR released their list of the 150 greatest albums made by women&lt;/a&gt;. On first glance, the list appears to be wide-reaching in its scope. Meshell Ndegeocello, Sleater-Kinney, and Egyptian superstar Umm Kulthum all make appearances, with iconic figures like Nina Simone and Joni Mitchell nabbing the top spots. However, renowned metal critic Kim Kelly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GrimKim/status/889874883143979010"&gt;quickly noted on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that the “definitive” countdown failed to include any albums metal albums by women—so she &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GrimKim/status/889931557921853442"&gt;Tweeted out a list of her own&lt;/a&gt;, and then a Spotify user named Jim Fenner compiled (most of) them all into a 1,023-track, 87-hour playlist. Kelly’s crash course does more than simply construct a history of women in metal; she highlights the diversity in female and non-binary artists who have transgressed the genre itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/svenmidnite/playlist/1mk3co1OHuF0pbz69tlMRb"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX0KzIgZnZaeE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bathroom Bans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Within the Spotify ecosystem, you’ll find a multitude of playlists created by the streaming service in response to current events, be it mixes that &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWZKpHIbfDI1i"&gt;benefit Mexico City’s earthquake victims&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX1lwjn4hAQau"&gt;expressions of support&lt;/a&gt; for American dreamers jeopardized by the Trump administration’s DACA repeal. But The Bathroom Bans (part of Spotify’s recently launched &lt;em&gt;I’m with the—banned&lt;/em&gt; series) is more than just a playlist protest against repeated attempts by Republican state government to enforce which type of public restrooms trans people are allowed to use. Threading expository animated videos (narrated by Halsey) with tracks by trans/gender-fluid artists and their vocal allies, it nudges the playlist format toward the realm of narrative documentary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX0KzIgZnZaeE"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/follow-lin-manuel-mirandas-puerto-rico-playlist/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lin-Manuel Miranda’s “For Puerto Rico” Playlist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;All-star charity singles have a bad reputation that is entirely earned. But &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt; playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda’s “Almost Like Praying” (proceeds from which benefited victims of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico) was unexpectedly fire, bringing together everyone from Jennifer Lopez to Dominican icon Juan Luis Guerra for an impassioned, dembow-driven love song to Puerto Rico. The track was introduced through Miranda’s “For Puerto Rico” playlist, which not only presented a soulful portrait of the Spanish-speaking Caribbean and its diaspora in the U.S., it also raised money for hurricane-relief efforts through a Spotify donation based on the number of followers it acquired. As an added incentive, the songwriter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/915957065285283846"&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; that, if the playlist hit 50,000 followers, he would share an old photo of himself, dressed as J.Lo. (At the time of this writing, the count was over 73,000, but we’re still waiting for the big reveal.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWVJYaFlGP5hP"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/aphex-twins-field-day/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aphex Twin’s Field Day set&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There’s a reason why Reddit users frantically threw together a playlist of the tracks that Aphex Twin spun during London’s Field Day just hours after the set ended on June 3. The U.K. producer born Richard James remains one of electronic music’s most cherished and mysterious figures, and the singularity of sound and vision has spawned a fervent fan base that tracks his every movement. Admittedly, listening to a playlist comprising tracks exclusively from a DJ set is an odd experience; as an unmixed, dangling historical artifact, experienced within the confines of headphones or home speakers, it’s not how or where James wanted this music to be heard. But your mind fills in some of the blanks: the 3D mapped light instillation; the entrances and exits of the segues; the sweat and flesh of the festival crowd. It’s an incomplete experience, but it’s also interactive, and feels less like you’re staring through a tiny peephole at a much larger world and more like you’re parsing an ancient, oblique text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/sojacalcium/playlist/5oKARXnU5mwY3eTA1WiMgU"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/frank-ocean-blonded/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frank Ocean’s Blonded&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After a four-year silence that ended with last year’s widely acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Blond(e)&lt;/em&gt;, Frank Ocean greeted 2017 with renewed vigor. On top of dropping a handful of new singles, he also released a dynamic playlist, “Blonded,” that appears far more personal and revelatory than the artist-branded content that label publicists crank out for streaming services. The first installment, revealed on February 24, included Celine Dion and Teen Suicide alongside obvious nods like Prince and Nina Simone. His March 10 update ventured further afield with jazz pianist Mary Lou Williams, prog-pop enigma Todd Rundgren, and techno iconoclast Actress. And this most recent update from this past August features everyone from Frank Sinatra to Geto Boys to Japanese Breakfast. “Blonded” aspires to the ideal of music consumption in the streaming era—now that we can listen to everything, we can consume anything (and switch things up when the mood strikes). It remains to be seen if Frank Ocean’s ideological generosity will eventually manifest in his music. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/frank_ocean/playlist/6HEegfWHhUcytwQFAm1QbK"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://wordpress-757276-2639300.cloudwaysapps.com/playlist/four-tets-50-hour-megamix/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four Tet’s 60-Hour (And Counting) Megamix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;At the time of this writing, the primary Spotify playlist by Four Tet (a.k.a UK producer/DJ Kieran Hebden) spans 695 songs and runs over 60 hours. By the time you read these words, it will have probably grown. Over the past few months, it seemed to serve primarily as a vehicle for Hebden to build anticipation for his ninth long-player, &lt;em&gt;New Energy&lt;/em&gt;, mixing in tracks from the record with songs from peers (Bicep), inspirations (Sly Stone), and aliases (um, &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5ZzXaAuivVXuQaHCaRuxlD"&gt;00110100 01010100&lt;/a&gt;, which is the artist page stub where an album of Four Tet b-sides resides in Spotify). DJ mixes are a dime-a-dozen, and it’s not hard to find plenty by Four Tet out there in the ether. What’s much more rare to find is such a comprehensive compendium of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the sounds that go into an artist’s aesthetic. For a veteran like Hebden, an experimental cosmonaut who’s as likely to fold 2-step garage into his music as he is ‘70s jazz fusion or Nigerian funk (or…Selena Gomez), a standard 15-track playlist simply wouldn’t capture the breadth of his tastes. Hell, 10 of those wouldn’t. At nearly 700 tracks and counting, this mix is at least beginning to come close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/k_hebden/playlist/2uzbATYxs9V8YQi5lf89WG"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;10. &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/ivankatrump/playlist/1cip3jpUJgjuoZAIEqDtUD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ivanka Trump’s 991122 Playlist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Even in the streaming-dominant age, it’s still extremely rare for a playlist to make international headlines—but then this feat is probably only the 8,654th weirdest thing to happen under the current presidential administration. On October 15, Ivanka Trump posted this cryptically titled playlist to her Spotify profile, and given its timing (appearing 10 days before her and Jared Kushner’s eighth anniversary) and the egregiously lovey-dovey nature of the songs featured within, &lt;a href="https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/bj7n43/reviewing-ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-love-sex-playlist"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.avclub.com/ivanka-trump-shared-a-21-minute-playlist-perfectly-desi-1819876254"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/ivanka-jared-sex-playlist-spotify"&gt;outlets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jared-ivanka-trump-sex-playlist_us_59ee2a01e4b003385ac12415"&gt;speculated&lt;/a&gt; that the mix was designed as the soundtrack to a sexy-time couple’s retreat. However when you consider the themes of nostalgia (Adele’s “We Were Young,” Bruno Mars’ “When I Was Your Man”) and looming separation (Sam Smith’s “Stay With Me,” Passenger’s “Let Her Go”) running throughout the playlist, it’s possible that Ivanka and Jared are actually preparing themselves for &lt;a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/11/jared-kushners-chances-of-staying-out-of-prison-ju.html"&gt;a different sort of getaway&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video" style="padding-bottom:33.75%"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/ivankatrump/playlist/1cip3jpUJgjuoZAIEqDtUD"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;None&lt;/div&gt;</content>
    <link href="https://www.the-dowsers.com/the-dowser-posts/10-playlists-mattered-2017"/>
    <summary>The Dowsers prides itself on being the first music magazine devoted to the playlist experience—and in 2017, that experience became all the more multi-faceted. By nature, playlist-making is a highly personal process, an opportunity for anyone to play the role of radio programmer and tailor their song selection to suit a particular mood, activity, or obsession. Increasingly, we’ve seen them become a more communal medium, whether it’s bands releasing a curated mix to hype a new record, streaming services using them to break new artists, fans crowd-sourcing set lists to create shareable post-show souvenirs, or one of the biggest rappers in the world taking the “playlists are the new albums” mantra literally. But in 2017, we also saw playlists that moved beyond the realm of the promotional to the political, be it through pointed statements or charity initiatives. It may still feel strange to think a playlist could change the world, but in 2017, the act of dragging-and-dropping reached new levels of artistry, activitism, and influence.1. Your Discover WeeklySpotify’s Discover Weekly playlist was launched in July of 2015, but with the music service now boasting more than 60 million paying subscribers and playlists eclipsing albums as the dominant way fans consume music, the weekly personalized mix is more relevant than ever. Essentially based on the concept of collaborative filtering, the algorithm looks at songs it knows you like, then recommends you songs adjacent to those songs in other users’ playlists and libraries. The result is often uncannily precient recommendations. If you’ve become as addicted to this playlist as so many others, there’s good news: The more users Spotify adds, the more data there is to mine, and the better these recommendations get. 2. RapCaviarIn 2017, RapCavier was the Avatar of playlists. It adorned billboards, spawned its own tour,stirred up controversy, and turned its creator, Tuma Basa, into an industry celebrity. It’s easy to be cynical about it all, but also very difficult to turn away. Week after week, it simply delivered the goods, helping break an entire new generation of rap artists (it’s no coincidence that Lil Uzi Vert headlined the tour) while also being one of the first playlists to incorporate video. In an era that was supposed to have decimated the tastemaker class, Basa and his playlist provided essential listening. 3. Drake, More LifeThis is among the best of Drake’s clumping-tracks-together things, and that’s very much because More Life is consciously a “playlist.” This isn’t a low-stakes gambit or a cheap marketing gimmick (at least not entirely), but an honest engagement with a new form. More Life is loose and meandering, and sometimes the individual components seem slight and tertiary. But like the best playlists, it captures a moment, a feeling, and a place. More Life is enjoyable and, as anyone who listens to a lot of classic albums knows, enjoying music trumps appreciating it—and this release is infinitely better than any other non-sweater-meme Drake release in years. For that, we can thank the generations of mixtape compilers, playlist curators, radio DJs, and compilation creators for helping define this new form. But, most of all, we should thank Drake for getting that the lines between artist, audience, critic, and curator are porous, and for making an initial foray into what this intersection looks like. 4. Grim Kim’s 150 Raddest Metal Albums Ever Made by People Who Happen To Not Be DudeThis past July, NPR released their list of the 150 greatest albums made by women. On first glance, the list appears to be wide-reaching in its scope. Meshell Ndegeocello, Sleater-Kinney, and Egyptian superstar Umm Kulthum all make appearances, with iconic figures like Nina Simone and Joni Mitchell nabbing the top spots. However, renowned metal critic Kim Kelly quickly noted on Twitter that the “definitive” countdown failed to include any albums metal albums by women—so she Tweeted out a list of her own, and then a Spotify user named Jim Fenner compiled (most of) them all into a 1,023-track, 87-hour playlist. Kelly’s crash course does more than simply construct a history of women in metal; she highlights the diversity in female and non-binary artists who have transgressed the genre itself.5. The Bathroom BansWithin the Spotify ecosystem, you’ll find a multitude of playlists created by the streaming service in response to current events, be it mixes that benefit Mexico City’s earthquake victims, or expressions of support for American dreamers jeopardized by the Trump administration’s DACA repeal. But The Bathroom Bans (part of Spotify’s recently launched I’m with the—banned series) is more than just a playlist protest against repeated attempts by Republican state government to enforce which type of public restrooms trans people are allowed to use. Threading expository animated videos (narrated by Halsey) with tracks by trans/gender-fluid artists and their vocal allies, it nudges the playlist format toward the realm of narrative documentary. 6. Lin-Manuel Miranda’s “For Puerto Rico” PlaylistAll-star charity singles have a bad reputation that is entirely earned. But Hamilton playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda’s “Almost Like Praying” (proceeds from which benefited victims of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico) was unexpectedly fire, bringing together everyone from Jennifer Lopez to Dominican icon Juan Luis Guerra for an impassioned, dembow-driven love song to Puerto Rico. The track was introduced through Miranda’s “For Puerto Rico” playlist, which not only presented a soulful portrait of the Spanish-speaking Caribbean and its diaspora in the U.S., it also raised money for hurricane-relief efforts through a Spotify donation based on the number of followers it acquired. As an added incentive, the songwriter pledged that, if the playlist hit 50,000 followers, he would share an old photo of himself, dressed as J.Lo. (At the time of this writing, the count was over 73,000, but we’re still waiting for the big reveal.)7. Aphex Twin’s Field Day setThere’s a reason why Reddit users frantically threw together a playlist of the tracks that Aphex Twin spun during London’s Field Day just hours after the set ended on June 3. The U.K. producer born Richard James remains one of electronic music’s most cherished and mysterious figures, and the singularity of sound and vision has spawned a fervent fan base that tracks his every movement. Admittedly, listening to a playlist comprising tracks exclusively from a DJ set is an odd experience; as an unmixed, dangling historical artifact, experienced within the confines of headphones or home speakers, it’s not how or where James wanted this music to be heard. But your mind fills in some of the blanks: the 3D mapped light instillation; the entrances and exits of the segues; the sweat and flesh of the festival crowd. It’s an incomplete experience, but it’s also interactive, and feels less like you’re staring through a tiny peephole at a much larger world and more like you’re parsing an ancient, oblique text.8. Frank Ocean’s BlondedAfter a four-year silence that ended with last year’s widely acclaimed Blond(e), Frank Ocean greeted 2017 with renewed vigor. On top of dropping a handful of new singles, he also released a dynamic playlist, “Blonded,” that appears far more personal and revelatory than the artist-branded content that label publicists crank out for streaming services.

It remains to be seen if Frank Ocean’s ideological generosity will eventually manifest in his music. 9. Four Tet’s 60-Hour (And Counting) MegamixAt the time of this writing, the primary Spotify playlist by Four Tet (a.k.a UK producer/DJ Kieran Hebden) spans 695 songs and runs over 60 hours. By the time you read these words, it will have probably grown. Over the past few months, it seemed to serve primarily as a vehicle for Hebden to build anticipation for his ninth long-player, New Energy, mixing in tracks from the record with songs from peers (Bicep), inspirations (Sly Stone), and aliases (um, 00110100 01010100, which is the artist page stub where an album of Four Tet b-sides resides in Spotify). DJ mixes are a dime-a-dozen, and it’s not hard to find plenty by Four Tet out there in the ether.

Short but sweet, these 10 tracks reveal that many if not most of the singer’s recent hits rely on samples for songwriting inspiration. It’s obvious that Whitney Houston’s deathless hi-NRG chestnut “I Wanna Dance With Somebody” informed the hook for the 2015 Jeremih smash with Natalie La Rose, “Somebody”; and that Snap!’s Euro-rave conqueror “Rhythm is a Dancer” led to his chorus on “Don’t Tell ‘Em.” But did anyone know that he copied a vocal line from Shai’s sappy a cappella ballad “If I Ever Fall In Love” for the hook of his most recent chart smash, “Oui”? One can conclude from this list that the “Birthday Sex” king has grown a little derivative, but leave it to Thisisrnb.com to assess his recent creative direction more kindly. “Some writers are just naturally gifted with the ability to remix, remake or flip a set of lyrics into a different melody or copy a melody with different lyrics,” goes the post, which is unsigned. “We’d be interested to know if he has been consciously doing remakes of big hits to hopefully land another big hit, or if it’s been more organic and just came out during sessions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="380" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7A5znUbGotfbTxh1yKaOWh?utm_source=generator" style="border-radius:12px" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
